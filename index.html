        <h2>What is a Solar Panel?</h2>
        <p>A Solar panels (also known as "PV panels") is a device that converts light from the sun, which is composed of particles of energy called "photons", into electricity that can be used to power electrical loads.

            Solar panels can be used for a wide variety of applications including remote power systems for cabins, telecommunications equipment, remote sensing, and of course for the production of electricity by residential and commercial solar electric systems.

        <h2>A Short History of Solar Panels</h2>
        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/10-2.png?fit=1200%2C675&quality=80&ssl=1" height="400px" width="800px">
        <p>The development of solar energy goes back more than 100 years. In the early days, solar energy was used primarily for the production of steam which could then be used to drive machinery. But it wasn't until the discovery of the "photovoltaic effect" by Edmond Becquerel that would allow the conversion of sunlight solar electric energy. Becquerel's discovery then led to the invention in 1893 by Charles Fritts of the first genuine solar cell which was formed by coating sheets of selenium with a thin layer of gold. And from this humble beginning would arise the device we know today as the solar panel.<br>

            Russel Ohl, an American inventor on the payroll of Bell Laboratories, patented the world's first silicon solar cell in 1941. Ohl's invention led to the production of the first solar panel in 1954 by the same company. Solar panels found their first mainstream use in space satellites. For most people, the first solar panel in their life was probably embedded in their new calculator - circa the 1970s!<br>
            
            Today, solar panels and complete solar panel systems are used to power a wide variety of applications. Yes, solar panels in the form of solar cells are still being used in calculators. However, they are also being used to provide solar power to entire homes and commercial buildings, such as Google's headquarters in California.</p>

        <h2>How Do Solar Panels Work?</h2>
        <img src="https://blog.feniceenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/3-phase-inverter.jpg" height="400px" width="800px">
        <p>Solar panels collect clean renewable energy in the form of sunlight and convert that light into electricity
             which can then be used to provide power for electrical loads. Solar panels are comprised of several individual solar cells which
              are themselves composed of layers of silicon, phosphorous (which provides the negative charge), and boron (which provides the positive charge). 
              Solar panels absorb the photons and in doing so initiate an electric current. The resulting energy generated from photons striking the surface of the solar panel allows electrons to be knocked out of their 
              atomic orbits and released into the electric field generated by the solar cells which then pull these free electrons into a directional current. 
              This entire process is known as the Photovoltaic Effect.<br>

        <h2>Benefits of Solar Panel</h2>
        <p>Using solar panels is a very practical way to produce electricity for many applications. The obvious would have to be off-grid living. 
           The greatest benefit that you would enjoy from the use of solar power is that it is both a clean and a renewable source of energy.
            Last, but not least, of the benefits of solar panels and solar power is that, once a system has paid for its initial installation costs, the electricity it produces 
            for the remainder of the system's lifespan, which could be as much as 15-20 years depending on the quality of the system, is absolutely free! </p>
